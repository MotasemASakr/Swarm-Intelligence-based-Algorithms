    "Firefly is a natural inspired metaheuristic search algorithm and its idea is that the fireflies (aka solutions) get attracted to the most luminous solution (aka fly) and try to follow that solution. Fireflies in natural don't get attracted to luminous objects but actualy get repulsed by lighting but for pedagogical reasons we assume that light attracts fireflies."
